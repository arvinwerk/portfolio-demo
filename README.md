# Resume

This portfolio is intended as a simple demo on how to make an angular app. Some methods that have been applied:
- Functional programming, so the functions can be tested and are predictable
- Declarative programming, instead of the traditional imperative programming for better scaling
- Reactive state management, keeping the state out of the component

# todo

- Add example jsons, so you can add your own json
- Add tests
- Create real API
- Add loaders and animations
