# Resume

This portfolio is intended as a simple demo on how to make an angular app. The main focus is the angular code, the scass is based on an existing theme. 

Some programming principles that have been applied:
- Functional programming, so the functions can be tested and the outcome is predictable
- Declarative programming, instead of the traditional imperative programming for better scaling readability
- Reactive state management, keeping the state out of the component to keep components simple

# todo

- Add example jsons, so you can add your own json
- Add tests
- Create real API
- Add loaders and css animations
